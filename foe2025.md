# Overview
Dear students, I put together a static webpage with some resources to get you started on your projects.  As the project progresses I will add more stuff to this webpage. If you would like to see other resources here, don't hesitate to let me know.   

__The EN25 prompt from the student's guide__: *Which policy features should a new EU ‘Clean Industrial Deal’ have

## How to organize your research
* __Finding articles__: You may find it useful to start reading some articles of interest and see which sources they cite. If you want to be more systematic, you can query __Web of Science__ or __Scopus__ with a well-constructed search string (if you would like to know more about this, we can discuss it during the office hours). Another cool alternative is https://www.researchrabbit.ai which can help you find papers on a similar topic through author networks. 
* __Managing your sources__: I find it helpful to organize my sources in __Zotero__. This is a software program where you can enter, organize and export sources. You can do the same with alternative software like __Evernote__.
