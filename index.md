## About Me

Hi there! I’m a PhD Candidate in Social and Political Science at Bocconi University in Milan. In my research I try to understand how illiberal political forces shape political attitudes and behaviors. This includes things like the public opinion effects of disruptive and violent protests, how the success of far-right politicians shapes how people treat minority groups, and how anti-establishment parties disrupt the legislative process. 

In the 2023–24 academic year, I was a visiting student at Princeton University and the London School of Economics.  Before my PhD, I was a Fulbright scholar at Duke University where I earned a Master’s degree in Liberal Studies (major: political science). Earlier on, I studied Media and Journalism at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam.
