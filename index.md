## About Me

Hi there! I’m a PhD Candidate in Social and Political Science at Bocconi University in Milan. In my research I try to understand when and why politics swings into illiberal directions and what the consequences are when this happens. This includes things like how people react to disruptive protests, when and why anti-establishment parties disrupt the legislative process, and how the success of far-right politicians shapes how people treat minority groups.

In the 2023–24 academic year, I was a visiting student at Princeton University and the London School of Economics.  Before my PhD, I was a Fulbright scholar at Duke University where I earned a Master’s degree in Liberal Studies (major: political science) and prior to this, I obatined a Masters's in Media and Journalism at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam.
