## About Me

Welcome! I'm a fourth-year PhD student in Social and Political Science at Bocconi University in Milan. My work explores when and why illiberal ideas and behaviors emerge, whether it's in parliamentary deliberations, on the streets during protests, or in citizens' minds and behaviors after contentious elections. I mostly focus on Western Europe and the United States. 

Before my PhD, I was a Fulbright scholar at Duke University, where I earned an MA in Liberal Studies with a focus on political science. I also studied media and journalism at Erasmus University Rotterdam. 

More recently, I spent time as a visiting student at Princeton (Fall 2023) and the London School of Economics (Spring 2024).
