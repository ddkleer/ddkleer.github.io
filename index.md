## About me 
Hi there! I’m a PhD Candidate in Social and Political Science at Bocconi University in Milan. I'm currently working remotely from Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In my main line of research I try to understand the broad consequences of far-right success in Western liberal democracies. This ranges from hate crimes against minority groups to the legislative behavior of far-right MPS. My research has been published in the _British Journal of Political Science_.

During the 2023–24 academic year, I was a visiting student at Princeton University and the London School of Economics.  Before embarking on a PhD, I obtained master's degrees from Duke University and the Erasmus University in Rotterdam.
