## About Me

Hi there! I’m a PhD Candidate in Social and Political Science at Bocconi University in Milan. I research the working parts and consequences of illiberal politics in Western democracies. This includes things like how people react to disruptive or violent protests, when and why anti-establishment parties disrupt the legislative process, and how the success of far-right politicians shapes how people treat minority groups.

In the 2023–24 academic year, I was a visiting student at Princeton University and, later, the London School of Economics.  Before my PhD, I was a Fulbright scholar at Duke University where I earned a Master’s degree in Liberal Studies (major: political science). I also studied Media and Journalism at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam.
