## About Me

Hello! I'm a fourth-year PhD student in Social and Political Science at Bocconi University in Milan, Italy. I study illiberal politics in Western liberal democracies. I am interested in how illiberal actors behave in different settings, and what the consequences are of their politics.

Before starting my PhD, I was a Fulbright graduate student at Duke University (2018-2020) in Durham, North Carolina. Here, I earned an MA in Liberal Studies, majoring in political science. I also studied media and journalism at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam before that time. 
During the 2023-34 academic year, I was a visiting student at Princeton (Fall 2023) and the London School of Economics (Spring 2024).
