## About Me

Hi there! I’m a PhD Candidate in Social and Political Science at Bocconi University in Milan. My research looks at different sides of ‘illiberal’ politics in Western democracies. This includes things like how people react to disruptive or violent protests, if far-right politicians are willing to work with others in parliament, and how the success of far-right politicians shapes public views of minority groups.

Before my PhD, I was a Fulbright scholar at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Here, I earned a Master’s degree in Liberal Studies (major: political science). I also studied media and journalism at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam. In the 2023–24 academic year, I was a visiting student at Princeton University and, later, the London School of Economics.
