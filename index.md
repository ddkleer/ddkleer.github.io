# About me 
I’m a PhD Candidate in Social and Political Science at Bocconi University in Milan. I'm currently working remotely from the Netherlands. 

In my research I try to understand the broad consequences of far-right success in Western liberal democracies. My research has been published in the _British Journal of Political Science_.

During the 2023–24 academic year, I was a visiting student at Princeton University and the London School of Economics.  Before my PhD, I was a Fulbright scholar at Duke University where I earned a Master’s degree in Liberal Studies (major: political science). I also studied Media and Journalism at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam.
