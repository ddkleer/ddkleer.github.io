I’m a PhD Candidate in Social and Political Science at Bocconi University in Milan. I'm currently working remotely from the Netherlands. 

In my research I try to understand the broad consequences of far-right success in Western liberal democracies. For example, I study how the electoral victories of far-right candidates change how we view and treat minorities. In other work, I study when and why (far-right) anti-establishment parties disrupt the legislative process, even when further removed from cameras and the public eye. In recently published work, I look at support for disruptive pro-environment (e.g. Extinction Rebellion) and environmental-critical protests (e.g. Farmers).My research has been published in the _British Journal of Political Science_.

During the 2023–24 academic year, I was a visiting student at Princeton University and the London School of Economics.  Before my PhD, I was a Fulbright scholar at Duke University, where I earned a Master’s degree in Liberal Studies (major: political science), and studied Media and Journalism at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam.
